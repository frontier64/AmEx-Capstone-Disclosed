Notes!
DialogFlow authentication: https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/v2-auth-setup
Google Cloud authentication: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/
Security:
    --Make sure that the cloud functions can only be accessed by DialogFlow
    --Make sure that our bot can only be accessed by our Slack bot
    --If one or both of these are are not true then we need to add more authentication to the bot than currently planned

Plan:
    Functions can only be accessed through our DialogFlow bot which can only be accessd through Slack (hopefully) so we
        can rely on access to a user's slack profile for authenticating users
    --Slack user and slack channel ID's are passed along with the request which can be used to access user info
        --Needs to be assigned to a user when they log in for the first time as well

Intents:

Entities:
	userInfo

getUserInfo:
	determines which user info the employee is requesting. Searches the database based off the slack_id of the requesting employee and queries for the relevant data. Must authenticate based on the slack auth token

setUserInfo:
	determines which user info the employee is trying to set. If the info is a settable form of info then sets the particular user info for the slack_id of the requesting employee in the database. Must authenticate based on the slack auth token.

Valid userInfoâ€™s:
pto
peopleID
email
supervisorID
location
name
status
serviceYears
band

New method is to have a separate intent for each valid UserInfo (e.g. get_pto, get_peopleID, etc.)

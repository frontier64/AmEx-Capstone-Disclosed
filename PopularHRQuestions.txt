HR/Employee Directory Questions (complex):
Anonymous complaints/concerns? (Provide a way for employees to tell HR about a problem without feeling like they'll be
    punished or face some consequences... would not track complaints with names but rather use a UUID for each person
    that are not directly tied to names in order to provide more information like if 40 complaints are attributed to one
    UUID you can figure that it's not multiple people complaining about one person/thing)
Request PTO next Tuesday.
Change my home address.
